# Project Title

## Advance House Price Prediction
#### A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
#### The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
#### The company wants to know the following things about the prospective properties:

#### 1) Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

#### 2)How well those variables describe the price of a house.

 

#### Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.


# Description

#### Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

#### With 81 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Australia this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Goal 

#### We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

# Steps involved in making the project 
#### Data cleaning , Data Visualization , Data Preparation , RFE(Recursive Feature Elimination) , Model Building (Ridge and Lasso Regression)

# Metric 

#### Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

# Projet Additional Requirements

#### This submission also has a subjective questions answers pdf which was asked in the assignment thus, the ipynb file is modified as per the needs og the assignment
